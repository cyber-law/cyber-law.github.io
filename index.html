    <h1 id="big">Should there be laws against cyberbullying?</h1>
    <p class="indent">I believe that laws shouldn’t not be created against cyberbullying. By making laws about cyberbullying the U.S. government is infringing on the citizen's first amendment rights. The first amendment states that “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.” This means that the cyberbullying laws will be violating the constitution. In addition Robert Bishop was arrested in 2012 for leaving a Facebook comment. He was arrested for using his rights as a U.S. citizen, yet luckily his conviction was overturned. Another reason laws shouldn’t be created against cyberbullying is because people have the option to turn off or ignore any harassment. Most social media networks, or any messaging service, allow the person to just flat out ignore the person, or people can just as easily ignore the person completely. Also must networking sites, or messaging services, allow the users to report harassment, which gets them removed from said service, but yet they don’t face criminal charges. FInally laws should not be created against cyberbullying because people only are looking for someone or something to blame. When any form of harassment happens people always look for something to blame, but people have the ability to turn the harassment online off, and if they don’t do that it’s the person who gets harassed fault. In addition when people commit suicide it’s the person who killed himself not the people who harassed them.  That is why I believe there shouldn’t be laws against cyberbullying.
